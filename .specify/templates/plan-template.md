# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Mandatory Principles Checklist

- [ ] **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Feature implemented as standalone service functions (no classes)
- [ ] **Dark/Light Mode Support**: All UI components use Mantine with theme-aware styling
- [ ] **Test-First Development**: Tests written and approved before implementation
- [ ] **Real-Time Capabilities**: WebSockets used for features requiring live updates
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: Audit trails implemented for business-critical operations
- [ ] **API-First Development**: REST endpoints with Zod validation and proper status codes
- [ ] **Accessibility & Responsive**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, responsive breakpoints, keyboard navigation
- [ ] **CSS Modules & Styling**: Components use CSS Modules (.module.css) with classnames, no inline styles
- [ ] **Component File Structure**: All components follow 4-file structure (index.ts, Component.tsx, .module.css, .test.tsx)
- [ ] **TypeScript Type Safety**: Strict types, no `any`, Zod schemas at boundaries
- [ ] **Database Operations**: Prisma ORM with migrations, proper indexing, audit logging
- [ ] **Security**: Authentication checks, input validation, permission verification
- [ ] **AI Integration**: Optional, fault-tolerant, with graceful degradation

### Violations Requiring Justification

*Complete table below ONLY if any constitutional requirements cannot be met:*

| Principle Violated | Why Required | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., Component Structure] | [specific constraint] | [why 4-file pattern not feasible] |

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
