- **npm**, **yarn**, or **bun** package manager

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Traditional Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd triven
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using bun (recommended)
bun install
```

#### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/triven"
SESSION_SECRET="your-session-secret"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="your-stripe-secret-key"
RESEND_API_KEY="your-resend-api-key"

# AI Assistant Configuration
OLLAMA_HOST="http://localhost:11434"

# Demo Request Configuration
SALES_TEAM_EMAILS="sales@triven.com,team@triven.com"
SEND_DEMO_CONFIRMATION="true"
```

#### 4. Database Setup
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:gen

# Push database schema
npm run db:push

# Seed with demo data
npm run db:reset
```

#### 5. AI Setup (Optional)
Install and start Ollama locally:
```bash
# Install Ollama (macOS)
brew install ollama

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Pull the required model
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

#### 6. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or with bun
bun run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

### Option 2: Docker Setup (Recommended for Production)

#### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd triven
cp .env.docker .env
```

#### 2. Update Environment Variables
Edit `.env` with your configuration:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/triven"
OLLAMA_HOST="http://ollama:11434"
NODE_ENV="development"
```

#### 3. Start with Docker Compose
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Run in background
docker-compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

This will start:
- **Main Application** on `http://localhost:3000`
- **Ollama AI Service** on `http://localhost:11434`
- **Automatic model download** (llama3.1:8b)

#### 4. Database Setup (Docker)
```bash
# Run database migrations
docker-compose exec app bun run db:push

# Seed with demo data
docker-compose exec app bun run db:reset
```

### Option 3: Production Deployment (Render.com)

#### 1. Prepare Repository
```bash
# Ensure all Docker files are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Add Docker configuration"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Deploy to Render
1. Connect your repository to Render.com
2. Render will automatically detect `render.yaml`
3. This creates two services:
   - **Main App** (Standard plan)
   - **Ollama AI** (Standard+ plan recommended)

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Set these in Render dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `OLLAMA_HOST` - URL of your Ollama service
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- Other environment variables as needed

#### 4. Important Notes for Production
- Ollama requires significant resources (2GB+ RAM)
- Model download takes time on first deployment
- Consider using Standard or Professional plans for AI service

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Docker/Ollama Issues
- **Ollama model not downloading**: Ensure sufficient disk space (8GB+ for llama3.1:8b)
- **Container out of memory**: Increase Docker memory allocation to 8GB+
- **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 3000 and 11434 are available
- **Model loading timeout**: First startup may take 10-15 minutes for model download

#### Development Issues
- **Database connection errors**: Verify PostgreSQL is running and connection string is correct
- **Build failures**: Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies
- **Type errors**: Run `npm run typecheck` to identify TypeScript issues

#### AI Assistant Issues
- **"AI service unavailable"**: Check if Ollama is running (`docker-compose logs ollama`)
- **Slow responses**: AI inference requires significant CPU, consider using GPU acceleration
- **Model not found**: Verify llama3.1:8b model is downloaded (`ollama list`)

### Performance Optimization
- Use GPU acceleration for Ollama when available
- Implement Redis caching for frequent queries
- Consider using lighter AI models for development
- Monitor resource usage with `docker stats`
