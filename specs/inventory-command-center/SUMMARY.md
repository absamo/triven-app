## What You Just Got

A **killer dashboard widget** that will differentiate Triven from every competitor in the inventory management space.

## The Big Idea

Most inventory software shows you **data**. Triven now shows you **what to do about it**.

### In One Widget, You Get:

1. **üéØ Health Score (0-100)**
   - Like a credit score for your inventory
   - Glanceable: Green = Good, Red = Problems
   - Tracks improvement over time

2. **‚ö° Critical Alerts (Top 3)**
   - Prioritized by financial impact
   - AI-predicted issues 7-30 days ahead
   - One-click solutions built-in

3. **üí∞ Revenue Opportunities**
   - "Restock these 5 products ‚Üí Unlock $12,500 in sales"
   - AI confidence scores
   - Actionable recommendations

4. **üìä Key Metrics**
   - Capital Tied Up (slow-moving inventory)
   - Revenue at Risk (stockouts)
   - Turnover Rate (efficiency)
   - Dead Stock (waste)

## Why It's a Game-Changer

> "You have 15 products with low stock"

### What Triven Shows:

### The Difference:
