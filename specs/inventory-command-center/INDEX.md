Calculated from:
- Stock Level Adequacy (30%)
- Turnover Rate (25%)
- Aging Inventory (20%)
- Backorder Rate (15%)
- Supplier Reliability (10%)

### 2. AI-Powered Alerts
Predictive warnings with financial impact:
- Stockout predictions (7-30 days ahead)
- Stock imbalances across locations
- Dead stock identification
- High-value backorders
- Supplier delay risks

**Key Differentiator**: Shows revenue impact, not just "low stock"

### 3. Revenue Opportunities
Money-focused insights competitors miss:
- Stockout prevention opportunities
- Price optimization recommendations
- Cross-sell opportunities
- Seasonal demand predictions

**Key Differentiator**: AI confidence scores + estimated revenue

### 4. One-Click Actions
